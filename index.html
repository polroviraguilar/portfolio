        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
          Monkey Island Fight is a solo project that reimagines the classic insult-sword-fighting mechanic from the legendary Monkey Island series. Developed during my Master’s program, this project is both a tribute and a technical exercise in narrative design.

  <!-- Introduction -->
  <section class="detail-section">
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      My goal was to faithfully recreate the charm and rhythm of the original insult fights. The game had to feel reactive, funny, and sharp — like a dance of words. I wanted the player to feel clever, not just win.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Dialogue System -->
  <section class="detail-section">
    <h3>Dialogue System</h3>
    <p>
      I designed a custom branching dialogue system that allows each insult and response to carry consequences, creating layered insult chains that escalate dynamically. The structure was built using C# scriptable objects and a simple state manager.
    </p>

  <!-- UI & Feedback -->
  <section class="detail-section">
    <h3>User Interface & Feedback</h3>
    <p>
      The UI was kept clean and retro-styled to reflect the original’s aesthetic. I added subtle animations and sound cues to reinforce the rhythm of exchange. Each insult and comeback has synced visual feedback to enhance punchlines.

  <!-- Timing System -->
  <section class="detail-section">
    <h3>Timing & Delivery System</h3>
    <p>
      Timing matters in comedy. I built a delay-and-pause system to control delivery pacing — allowing jokes to land properly. Pauses between lines are dynamically calculated based on the player’s reading speed and choice timing.

    <h3>What I Learned</h3>

      This project helped me understand how humor is not just written — it’s engineered. Timing, UI pacing, player agency and visual feedback all matter in delivering something that feels funny and interactive. It also deepened my skills with state machines, dialogue trees, and Unity UI tooling.

  <!-- Introduction -->
  <section class="detail-section">
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      My goal was to reproduce the gameplay feel and structure of Super Mario Bros’ first level as closely as possible. I focused on physics, collision, jumping timing, and enemy behavior to recreate the challenge and joy of platforming.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Physics & Player Control -->
  <section class="detail-section">
    <h3>Physics & Player Control</h3>
    <p>
      One of the biggest challenges was matching the exact jump arc and momentum of Mario. I used Unity’s physics engine but heavily customized it to recreate the “snappy yet floaty” feel. Movement is frame-perfect, and acceleration varies depending on ground, air, and sprinting states.

  <section class="detail-section">
    <h3>Level Design</h3>
    <p>
      Even though there are subtle alterations, I recreated the first level tile-by-tile based on references and gameplay videos. Every block, pipe, and gap is positioned to reflect the original game’s learning curve and rhythm. Invisible blocks, enemy placement, and power-ups were meticulously adjusted.

  <!-- Introduction -->
  <section class="detail-section">
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      The idea behind Mecha Tactics was to create a tactical experience that’s both accessible and deep. I aimed to capture the strategic essence of Worms while introducing modern features like advanced destructibility, unique mech abilities, and a clean UI that enables fast-paced, decision-heavy gameplay.

  <!-- Physics & Player Control -->
  <section class="detail-section">
    <h3>Physics & Player Control</h3>
    <p>
      One of the biggest challenges was implementing realistic 2D physics for movement, projectile impacts, and terrain destruction. Each mech has custom weight and friction values, affecting how they move and react to explosions. I also implemented an “aim assist” system to help players when firing weapons.

      In this project, I enhanced my knowledge and implementation of tilesets by making them directly interactive for players. I developed a collision detection system that allows bullets to destroy tiles within the impact area.

      <h2>Hi, I'm Pol</h2>
      <p>I’m a 27-year-old game developer currently working at <strong>UManresa</strong> in Barcelona, Spain.</p>
      <p>I describe myself as a <strong>problem solver</strong> who seeks every opportunity to learn and improve. I enjoy building games that <em>feel great to play</em> and writing <strong>clean, readable code</strong>. I thrive on difficult challenges—maybe a bit too much, as I often struggle to let go when I’m deep into debugging something tricky!</p>
      <p>If you're curious to know more, feel free to get in touch or check out my work below.</p>
