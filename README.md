# 🎮 Pol Rovira – Game Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio – a curated showcase of my work across **game development**, **pixel art**, and **3D modeling**.  
This site is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**, and hosted with **GitHub Pages**.

## 🧠 About Me

I'm **Pol Rovira**, a passionate **game developer** based in Barcelona, currently working at **UManresa**. I love crafting interactive experiences that fuse technical skill with artistic flair.

Whether I’m developing systems in **Unity**, animating in **Aseprite**, or modeling in **Blockbench**, I strive to make things that are fun, polished, and meaningful.

> 🎯 I build games that feel good to play — and I care deeply about clean code, player feedback, and visual design.
